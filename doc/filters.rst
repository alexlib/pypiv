Filters for outlier detection
=============================

In order to remove outliers from the resulting vector field, filters are used.
The filter mainly used here differs from the :doc:`Velocity Filter <velofilter>`.

The filter is called by the function

.. autofunction:: filters.outlier_from_local_median
